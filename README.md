# ai-reports-generator

Feel free to check the spreadsheet I'm currently using as a test for the jobs_salary_report.py: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C8LzKiRSzJ6c_rZuG165M9v5ExGgi1f-LiVy_ZIKR4/edit?usp=sharing

You can also use your own Google Cloud credentials and ChatGPT's API key to try the report generator (currently using OAuth2), rememeber to allow access to the Google Sheets API in your Google Cloud project and change the spreadsheet_id in jobs_salary_report.py to your spreadsheet id.

I'm working on new ways of working with large datasets in the ChatGPT's API and to keep the cost as small as possible. You can try to use it as it is now by using a small dataset that generates an ammount of tokens that's acceptable by the API.

Also, fell free to reach out if you have any doubts or would like to collaborate in the project.
