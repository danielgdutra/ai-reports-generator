# ai-reports-generator

Feel free to check the sheet I'm currently using as a test for the jobs_salary_report: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C8LzKiRSzJ6c_rZuG165M9v5ExGgi1f-LiVy_ZIKR4/edit?usp=sharing

You can also use your own Google Cloud credentials and ChatGPT's API key to try the report generator (currently using oauth2), rememeber to allow access to the google sheets api in your google cloud project and change the spreadsheet_id in jobs_salary_report.py to your spreadsheet id.

The integration with chatgpt is in progress...
